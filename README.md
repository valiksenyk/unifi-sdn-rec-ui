# UniFi

I use Angular 5 for this project because I have a lot of experience working with this framework, also I can 
create such a project on an AngularJs. But I chose Angular 5 through the AngularCLI, which allows you to run and assemble the project much faster.
I'm also familiar with the React, but I have no experience in the work with it.

[Used ng2-konva](http://rafaelescala.com/ng2-konva/) to draw shapes.

Also i deploy this app in hosting, so you can see:
[Demo](http://unifi-sdn-rec-ui.kl.com.ua/)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
